# Sorting-Algorithms

## Merge Sort
  - Merge sort is a recursive algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer concept by splitting the data at its midpoint, then continue to split the data and recursively sort the subdata. Next, combine the sorted subdata back into the single sorted subdata
  
## Insertion Sort
  - Insertion sort is an algorithm that iterates from data[1] to data[n] over and array and compares the current element to its predecessor. Moves the greater elements one position up to make space for the element to swap.
